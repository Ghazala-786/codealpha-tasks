# Age Calculator

Welcome to my **Age Calculator** project! This is a simple, stylish, and interactive web-based tool that calculates a person's age based on their date of birth. It is designed to demonstrate the use of modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on any device.
- **Interactive Animations**: Subtle transitions and hover effects for a better user experience.
- **Dynamic Age Calculation**: Calculates years, months, and days accurately.
- **Clean and Modern UI**: Built with advanced CSS techniques for an elegant look.

## How It Works

1. Enter your date of birth in the input field.
2. Click on the **Calculate Age** button.
3. The tool dynamically displays your age in years, months, and days.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into three files:

1. **index.html**: The main structure of the webpage.
2. **styles.css**: Handles the styling and animations.
3. **script.js**: Includes the logic for calculating the age.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and adding animations.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the dynamic age calculation logic.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. Start calculating your age!

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for calculating time until next birthday.
- Display a graphical representation of the age.
- Make the tool more accessible for screen readers.

## Why I Built This

I created this project during my internship to enhance my web development skills, especially in creating interactive and visually appealing web applications. It showcases my understanding of combining functionality with design.
